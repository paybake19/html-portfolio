<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
 My name is Payton and I am learning full-stack development. So far on this journey I have completed 
Harvards CS50P Course and am currently enrolled in a web development course where I am learning HRML, 
CSS, and Java programming. I am excited to continue this journey and learn more about web development 
and programming in general.<br />

Please let me know if you have questions or want to connect!
